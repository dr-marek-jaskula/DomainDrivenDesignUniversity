# Tests.Performance Layer :heavy_check_mark:

NBomber is used as a framework for performance tests, because we can easily use it from xunit test. So only c# code is required. 

This tests can show us whether to use .AsSplitQuery or is it worth to omit some not crucial logging.

Use these tests without containerized application and for the database that is locally installed.
